# Setup

The only thing needed is an empty database. Can be configured here: persistence.xml, hibernate.cfg.xml

## Note

Eclipse has a bug and displays an error about User class:

> Class "net.horvoje.querydsl.bugs.contains.entity.User" is listed in the persistence.xml file, but is not annotated

This can be ignored meaning project will run no matter this error displayed.
